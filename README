This is a very simple example of how to do texturing with OpenGL 4.5 while still
using glBegin...glEnd and skipping the whole shader language.   This second 
example shows how to load and use multiple textures but is still inefficient 
because all of the work is done in the display function.

On the soilsrc branch I have also built a method for building things in separate
directories and utilizing files from separate directories.  Based on the OReilly
reference 

https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-projects-with/0596006101/ch06.html

(and personal experience) the make facility works optimally well when 
operating on targets within a single directory.
